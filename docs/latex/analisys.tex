{\color{blue} Together with the next chapter takes about 60\% of the whole paper.\\}

The purpose of this chapter is to explain the operating principles of the implemented application.
Here you write about your solution from a theory standpoint â€“ i.e. you explain it and demonstrate its theoretical properties/value, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
	\item used or proposed algorithms,
	\item used protocols,
	\item abstract models,
	\item logic explanations/arguments concerning the chosen solution,
	\item logic and functional structure of the application, etc.
\end{itemize}

YOU SHOULD NOT write about implementation. 
	
YOU SHOULD NOT copy/paste information on technologies and other alike from various sources, which do not pertain to your project (no fillers, please!).
