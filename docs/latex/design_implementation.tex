{\color{blue}Together with the previous chapter takes about 60\% of the paper.\\}

The purpose of this chapter is to document the developed application such a way that it can be maintained and developed later. A reader should be able (from what you have written here) to identify the main functions of the application.
The chapter should contain (but not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
	\item a general application sketch/scheme,
	\item a description of every component implemented, at module level,
	\item class diagrams, important classes and methods from key classes.
\end{itemize}
