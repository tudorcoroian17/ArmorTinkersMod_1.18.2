{\color{red}\large{\bf READ FIRST} (this page should be removed from the final version)}:\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	If you print the thesis on paper, the three preceding pages (title page, summary page and declaration) should be printed on separate pages (one-side) and should be included in the printed paper. The summary page (the second one) must be signed by the graduate and the supervisor. The date on the declaration should be the date when the thesis is handed to the commissionsâ€™ secretary.
	\item	On the title page, you should include the correct scientific title of your supervisor (use the Department web pages to find that).
	\item Every chapter begins on a new page.
	\item Do not change page margins.
	\item Obey the other instructions provided in every chapter.
	\item This template obeys all the formatting rules.
	\item We included the \verb+hyperref+ package to generate navigation links. To produce  a version for printing on paper uncomment the line containing \verb+%\hypersetup{hidelinks}+
	located in the beginning of the main file \verb+thesis_rom.tex+. 
\end{enumerate}
